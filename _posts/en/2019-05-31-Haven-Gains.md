## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Havens are in demand this morning as risk taking takes a back seat on global trade fears. The yen is the biggest winner, with the USD/JPY hitting its lowest level since the start of February. Other yen pairs are extending their recent sorry runs, with the GBP/JPY dropping further below 138.00. The EUR/JPY is enduring a torrid run and is set for its lowest closing level for 2019. The AUD/JPY is also slipping below the May lows at 75.50. 

The Swiss franc is also enjoying gains, forcing the USD/CHF lower to test the 1.0050 level. The EUR/CHF is struggling for the third day in a row. 

The dollar is struggling though, with the US dollar index slipping back from the highs. Dollar pairs are enjoying gains, with the AUD/USD bouncing after holding 0.6900. The EUR/USD is making small gains at the end of a poor week, meanwhile the GBP/USD is unchanged at the lows, while the EUR/GBP is holding at the highs.
