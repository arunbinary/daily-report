## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning the Japanese yen is in control as traders seek out safer harbours. The yen pairs are on the back foot, as the USD/JPY drops for the second straight day, with the lows at 109.00 the likely target. 

The GBP/JPY is extending its losing run, though is holding up relatively well this morning. The lows at 138.00 appear a formality though. The EUR/JPY is dropping further, with support at 122.00 now broken. The AUD/JPY remains rangebound. 

The dollar index is on the back foot and is being forced lower by the strength of the yen. The AUD/USD is higher for the second straight day, with the GBP/USD also showing some relative strength after two days of losses. The EUR/USD is struggling by contrast after two days of losses. 

The USD/CHF is lower after hefty gains yesterday that pushed the pair above 1.0050. 

## Coming up today	

At 14.00, we get the BOC rate statement, with overnight rate at 14.00. 

## Trade Idea

While European leaders battle for control of the EU parliament, the EUR/JPY continues to struggle.
